# TCP over UDP Protocol
  
Program 1:

Client using customized protocol on top of UDP protocol for sending information to the server.

1. Compile the Server program using the following command on terminal: "cc udp_server.c -o udp_server.out"

2. Compile the Client program using the following command on terminal: "cc udp_client.c -o udp_client.out"


3. Always run the Server first, using the following command on terminal: "./udp_server.out 9002"

	You can specify any port number (Preferrably above 9000), but make sure that you specify the same port number while running the client


4. Run the client next, using the following command on the terminal: "./udp_client.out localhost 9002
"

5. Start transmitting and receiving packets.


6. Output of the program is similar to the output images attached during submission.  

Program 2:

Client using customized protocol on top of UDP protocol for requesting identification from server for access permission to the network.

1. Compile the Server program using the following command on terminal: "cc udp_server.c -o udp_server.out"


2. Compile the Client program using the following command on terminal: "cc udp_client.c -o udp_client.out"


3. Always run the Server first, using the following command on terminal: "./udp_server.out 9002"
	
You can specify any port number (Preferrably above 9000), but make sure that you specify the same port number while running the client


4. Run the client next, using the following command on the terminal: "./udp_client.out localhost 9002"


5. Start transmitting and receiving packets.
